WE ARE PRISME STUDIO

PRISME Studio is an independent video game studio based in France and created in 2020 during containment linked to the COVID-19 epidemic affecting the whole world.
Our mission is to create the best games for our players and thus bring together a large community of players from all walks of life.
In 2020, when the studio was created, it is also the start of the development of "In Depth" which will be PRISME Studio's very first game.
